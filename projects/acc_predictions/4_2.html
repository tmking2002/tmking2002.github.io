        There have been some big changes in the tournament odds after this past weekend. First, some remarks about the simulations themselves. Previously, I have used a model utilizing only differences in RPI between teams to simulate the games, but I have since upgraded to a 'power rating' system, and I'm hoping to have a full summary of it up in the next few days. Also, I have changed the top5 column to instead be top6 (to reflect the 6 teams which will receive a bye in the first round of the tournament).
    </p>
    
    <p style="max-width: 400px; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 560px">
        Now, into the actual news of the weekend. First and foremost, Pitt picked up two huge wins against Notre Dame this weekend, which has drastically shaken up the bottom half of the standings. Notre Dame has now dropped at least one game to 3 of the bottom 5 teams in the ACC (NCSU, Syracuse and now Pitt), which does not bode well for the rest of their season, but I'll touch more on that later. Also, UNC picked up a big win in game 3 of their series against Virginia, leaving the door open for them to get that last bye. Other than those, most of the series went mostly as expected, but here's a full rundown of each segment of the standings.
    </p>
    
    <h4 style="max-width: 400px; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 695px">Top of the Top</h4>
    
    <p style="max-width: 400px; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 560px">
        The teams in this segment are remaining completely unchanged from last week, but Virginia Tech took a huge step back after losing their series to Duke. Clemson, Louisville, and Florida State all took care of business (as expected) and swept their weekend series.
    </p>
    
    <h4 style="max-width: 400px; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 690px">Battle for the Bye</h4>
    
    <p style="max-width: 400px; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 560px">
        This segment of the standings has closed up significantly in the past week. With UNC losing the tiebreaker to Virginia, they fall 3 wins behind, and it would take some big wins to make up that difference. UVA has VT and FSU in their next two series, so nothing is out of the realm of possibility, but the race is much more cut and dry at this point. Notre Dame losing the series to Pitt (At home!), has undoubtedly put them into panic mode. It's hard to pin down one aspect of their game in particular that is causing their underperformance so far, but freshman Micaela Kastor has struggled significantly in ACC play (4.91 ERA vs. 0.23 ERA in out of conference games).
    </p>
    
    <h4 style="max-width: 400px; margin-top: 40px; margin-left: 695px">On the Bubble</h4>
    
    <p style="max-width: 400px; margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 560px">
        At this point, 4 teams are firmly on the bubble to take the last spot in the tournament, Pitt, Georgia Tech, NC State, and Syracuse. Barring some incredible run by Boston College, at this point, I'd say that they're out of the running to clinch a tournament spot. Susannah Anderson and Abby Dunning have both struggled significantly (7.52 and 5.74 ERAs respectively), and don't show any sign of life at the moment. From these simulations, the average number of wins required to make the tournament is 7.8, so the goal for these bubble teams should be to somehow get to the 8 win threshold. With all of these teams having series against each other, it's difficult to predict exactly how the standings will shake out for the rest of the season, but here are some big matchups to look forward to this coming weekend: NC State @ Syracuse, Boston College @ Georgia Tech, and Pitt @ UNC.
